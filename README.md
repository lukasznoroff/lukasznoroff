### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Lukasz
#### Front-End Developer


I am a motivated frontend developer seeking a full-time position in the field of coding where I can apply my knowledge and skills for continuous improvement. As a future web developer I like to create projects from scratch but also improve existing ones. For the last two years I have built several commercial projects. Current projects I build used HTML, SASS, JAVASCRIPT. I'm still learning and I'm hungry for knowledge so I started a year-long course in which I learn REACT JS, NODE JS, EXPRESS JS.

Skills: REACT / WORDPRESS / JS / HTML / CSS
